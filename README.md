Well, as clueless i was at the beginning of any programming language, (as curious i am) one hard phase i went through was "Compiling and Executing a code a million times".  
We all have been there, laugh at it. This code helped to me make any amount of changes to my code, and compile and run it in one click.

What / How TO:
==============

..This program automates the process of Compiling and Execution in one click.
..(When using Editors like 'SUBLIME' etc)
..Place this file, where the code is present.
..Enter File Name with Extension.
..In case of Extension mismatch, you are offered to add custom command line.
..You can minimize this app or let it run in background.
..Auto App LAUNCH can be toggled.
..Press 'F5' to initiate.
